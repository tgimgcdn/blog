## Modify Comment System Parameters

This blog system comes with a built-in [giscus](https://giscus.app/) comment component. The following steps will guide you through its configuration:

<Steps>

1. **Prepare a GitHub Repository**  
   - If your blog was deployed via the [Canjie - A modern personal blogging system based on Astro + Starlight](https://canjie.org/en/blog/project/canjie-system-introduction), then you already have a public repository.  
   - If you built your project manually, go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and create a new public repository.

2. **Install the giscus GitHub App**  
   - Visit the [giscus app page](https://github.com/apps/giscus) and click **Install** to add it to your repository. Otherwise, visitors will not be able to comment or reply.

3. **Enable the Discussions Feature**  
   - Go to your GitHub repository  
   - Click **Settings** in the top navigation  
   - Scroll down and find the **Discussions** option, then enable it  
   - Once enabled, the **Discussions** tab will appear at the top of the repository
